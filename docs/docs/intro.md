# Introduction

## Description

`quickopt` is a Python optimization toolkit developed in C++ geared towards nonlocal optimization problems, such as those encountered in hyperparameter tuning. 

It contains a variety of optimization algorithms, which are listed below. 

The package is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to use popular optimization methods out of the box in as little as one line of code, while also allowing users to customize the optimization process to suit their needs. 

A list of the optimization algorithms included in the package is provided below:

- **Simulated Annealing:** Compatible with `string`, `float`, and `integer` inputs

- **Bayesian Optimization with Tree-Structrued Parzen Estimators:** Compatible with `float` inputs

- **Genetic Algorithm:** Compatible with `string`, `float`, and `integer` inputs

- **Particle Swarm Optimization:** Compatible with `float` inputs

with more to come soon!

## What to Expect

This documentation will provide a guide on how to use the algorithms provided in `quickopt`, as well as example usages, descriptions of the algorithms, and references to learn more.

## Installation
